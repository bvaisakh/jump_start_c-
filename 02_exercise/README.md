## extern "C"

- extern "C" tells the C++ compiler that you have a function which was compiled by the C compiler.
- Once you tell it that it was compiled by the C compiler, the C++ compiler will know how to call it correctly.
- It also allows the C++ compiler to compile a C++ function in such a way that the C compiler can call it.
